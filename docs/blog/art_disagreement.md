        benefit of doubt.

    - On masking opinions from challenge
        - I recognise as this therefore I think can be a dangerous precedent.

    - On the purpose of opinion
        - The purpose of opinion isnâ€™t to depart from facts but to use them as a
        bridge to a larger idea called **truth**.
