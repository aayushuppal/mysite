# Calm of the Qualm

!!! quote "Aayush Uppal | 2016"
    <center><h4>“ To comprehend is not a concern to be,<br/>
    cause justification ain’t the order of the disorder.”</h4></center>

    The tree that stands in a storm, A wind that strikes your face.<br/>
    Every leaf that is stripped of it and in the fall of a branch.<br/>
    There lies a resistance to every single blow and a disorder for the wanted.

    It’s time when sense has a jurisdiction that gets felt.<br/>
    The wrath seems to be a nagging pain,<br/>
    and when urgency overrides every reason and culminates in a qualm.

    <h4>There lies a particular rosiness to this disorder, the sense of disengaging
    and the idea of destruction.</h4>

    The peace of mind and the calm of the qualm is a rather violent expression to peace.

    It’s when mind feels numb and the single streak of the faintest expression
    multiplies, segregates and defragments.<br/>
    The still in this storm is a rockier one, a steadier one, the one that apparently
    resides and hides in our pangs.

    <h4>The feeling of being a part of an expression that we visibly connect to
    elevates our emotions and the being to be rid of these pangs gets stronger
    in the storm.</h4>

    A release that finally escapes in the mid of it gives a weird numbness.<br/>
    An intoxication of a tranquil trance, a sense of control and of all the things in hand.

    Apprehensions seem to die and a pandemonium arises.<br/>
    Things that may have felt so cynical but for the moment the moment beholds
    ceases and overrides a worldly sense.

    <h4>Palpable it gets all through even to the slightest to the smallest of fragments
    of conscience. This expressionism that defies mind soothes within and spreads
    a calm.</h4>

    <center><h4>"These ideas seem quasi but the storm ain’t,<br/>
    A flaw seems to be the logic but the expression ain’t."</h4></center>
