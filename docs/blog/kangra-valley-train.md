!!! quote "Aayush Uppal | 2018-04-22"
    If you think of it, a picture is a 3D space representation. It spans across time with the idea it captures across
    the literal distance it maps on to the canvas and well nothing brings this idea to more prominence than this
    picture above.

    But that isn't the only reason I find this so captivating. Those mountains right in the backdrop are something
    I am fond of, the nooks and crevices etched on that landscape are more familiar to me than the lines on the
    back of my hand.

    The line thins for a picture like this for someone like me, is it the picture I am looking at or the memory that
    plays back. If I close my eyes It almost plays back as a motion poster through the dense greens from the far edge
    on a clear evening after the rain.
