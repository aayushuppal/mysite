# Ordinary Emotion

!!! quote "Aayush Uppal | 2018-04-23"
    But what is ordinary may never last, yet more often than not it does.

    Often chasing the grandest of ideas

    I don't know what it is.

    So at this point I am not quite sure if there is an ordinary emotion anymore. But what I do know is my perspective
    has evolved and I feel like I am going to hold dear to the moment.
